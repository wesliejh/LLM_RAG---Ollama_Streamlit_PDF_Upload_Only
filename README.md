This repository includes a jupyter notebook and python file for utilization of Ollama + RAG

The Jupyter Notebook is only for reviewing how the opensource libraries work for extracting text from PDF image and then embedding into a ChromaDB vector database for reference.


The python file can be ran locally, and utilizes only PDF files for upload and then stored into ChromaDB.
